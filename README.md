# frontend-data

## üìã My concept

Hi! Welcome to my repository for the two week course frontend-data! Here you can find the website I produced during the two week course.

We were tasked to create a data visualization using the `D3js` library. This datavisualization had to implement the three specific `D3js` methods from the library. The `enter()`, `update()` and `exit()` methods. I used the following question as the basis of my datavisualization.

- How has the problem of overweight in the Netherlands developed in recent years?

I used the answers to this question to create my visualizations. Feel free to clone this repository or visit this [site](https://steinberg99.github.io/frontend-data/) and take a look!

> **NOTE:** The content on this website is completely written in Dutch!
